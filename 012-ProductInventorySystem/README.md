# Product Inventory System

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js (v18+)**: Download and install from https://nodejs.org/
2. **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)

To verify your installation, run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

---

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash

   ```

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/product-inventory-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/product-inventory-system.git)
cd product-inventory-system

````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
````

3. **Start the server**

   ```bash

   ```

npm start

```

You should see this message in your terminal:
```

Server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

````

Now your API is ready to use!

TIP : You can use npm run dev instead of npm start to use nodemon where you dont need to start the server everytime you save anything, It will be done automatically.

## Overview of CRUD Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints under the base URL `http://localhost:3000`:

| Operation | HTTP Method | Endpoint             | Purpose                       |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Create    | POST        | `/products`          | Add a new product             |
| Read All  | GET         | `/products`          | List all products             |
| Read One  | GET         | `/products/:id`      | Get details of one product    |
| Update    | PUT         | `/products/:id`      | Modify an existing product    |
| Delete    | DELETE      | `/products/:id`      | Remove a product              |

## Example Request & Response Formats

Below youâ€™ll find example `curl` commands; you can also use tools like Thunderclient(VS code Extension), Postman or Insomnia.

### 1. Create a Product

- **URL:** `POST http://localhost:3000/products`
- **Request Headers:**
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Request Body:**
```json
{
 "name": "Widget",
 "quantity": 10,
 "price": 9.99,
 "description": "A useful widget."
}
````

- **Response (201 Created):**

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- `id` is the unique identifier auto-generated by the database. This shows the id of the product you just created.

---

### 2. List All Products

- **URL:** `GET http://localhost:3000/products`
- **Response (200 OK):**

  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Widget",
      "quantity": 10,
      "price": 9.99,
      "description": "A useful widget."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Gadget",
      "quantity": 5,
      "price": 19.99,
      "description": "An advanced gadget."
    }
  ]
  ```

---

### 3. Get One Product by ID

- **URL:** `GET http://localhost:3000/products/1`
- **Response (200 OK):**

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Widget",
    "quantity": 10,
    "price": 9.99,
    "description": "A useful widget."
  }
  ```

- **If Not Found (404 Not Found):**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Product not found"
  }
  ```

---

### 4. Update a Product

- **URL:** `PUT http://localhost:3000/products/1`

  - `Content-Type: application/json`

- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Widget",
    "quantity": 15,

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If you get an error like `EADDRINUSE`, it means the port is already in use. Stop any other server listening on `3000`, or change the port in `index.js`.
- To reset all data, stop the server, delete `inventory.db` in the root, then restart with `npm start`.
- Use `npm run dev` (with nodemon) to auto-reload on code changes:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  # add "dev": "nodemon index.js" to scripts in package.json
  npm run dev
  ```

Youâ€™re all set! ðŸŽ‰ Now you can build on this foundation or integrate it into larger projects. Happy coding!
