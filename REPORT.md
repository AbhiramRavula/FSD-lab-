└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘              └─────────────────┘
```

### Frontend Architecture (React)
- **Single Component Design**: All functionality consolidated in `App.jsx`
- **State Management**: React's built-in `useState` hooks
- **API Integration**: Custom fetch functions in `api.js`
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design principles
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture (Node.js)
- **RESTful API**: Express.js server with proper HTTP methods
- **Database Layer**: SQLite with normalized table structure
- **Business Logic**: Grade calculations and data validation
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing enabled
- **Development Tools**: Nodemon for auto-restart during development

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Structure
```sql
-- Students Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    roll_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Subjects Table
CREATE TABLE subjects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Marks Table
CREATE TABLE marks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    student_id INTEGER,
    subject_id INTEGER,
    marks_obtained INTEGER NOT NULL,
    max_marks INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (subject_id) REFERENCES subjects (id)
);
```

### Data Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: Student → Marks (One student can have multiple subject marks)
- **Many-to-One**: Marks → Subject (Multiple marks entries can reference one subject)
- **Cascade Delete**: When student is deleted, all associated marks are removed

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Adding a Student
1. User fills form in React frontend
2. Frontend validates data locally
3. API call sent to backend via fetch
4. Backend validates and sanitizes data
5. Student record created in database
6. Marks inserted with foreign key relationships
7. Grades calculated using helper functions
8. Response sent back to frontend
9. UI updated with new student data

### Grade Calculation Process
1. System sums all marks_obtained for a student
2. System sums all max_marks for the same student
3. Percentage calculated: `(total_obtained / total_max) * 100`
4. Letter grade assigned based on percentage thresholds
5. Both values stored in memory and sent to frontend
